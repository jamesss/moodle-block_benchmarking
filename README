MOODLE COURSE BENCHMARKING BLOCK
================================
James Simpson


Extract the contents into <moodleroot>/blocks/benchmarking/*

Carefully read the instructions in the config.php file located
in the benchmarking folder. You can use the default configuration
or you may wish to implement your own.

Navigate to your site's admin index.

You may wish to install the Benchmarking block as a 'sticky'
block (which will cause it to appear on every course page).
This can be done via the admin menu.

This block is for Moodle 1.9.x but may work on earlier
versions.
